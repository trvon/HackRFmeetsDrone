# HackRF meets Drone

## Project Idea
To use a HackRF to capture the communication between a reciever and quad copter and control the quad copter from a hackRF.
Based on this [project](https://ossmann.blogspot.com/2013/06/hackrf-lego-car.html)

## Things to look into
- [ ] Is there any steps taken to authenticate quad copter and controller?
- [ ] How does authentication affect communication the performance?
- [ ] What does the intial handshake look like?

## Useful Information
HackFR frequency range is 1Mhz to 6GHz and the quadcopter [antenna](https://fpv-flightclub.com/products/lumenier-axii-stubby-5-8ghz-antenna-rhcp/) frequency is 5.8 GHZ.
